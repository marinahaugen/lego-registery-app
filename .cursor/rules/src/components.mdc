## General:

- Favor functional patterns over classes. 
- Component structure: define props interfaces at the top; use named exports; avoid anonymous default exports.
- Hooks: always prefix custom hooks with use. For data fetching, prefer SWR's useSWR with proper keys and revalidation; include loading and error states.
- State management: if global state is needed, recommend lightweight libraries (e.g. Zustand) but avoid over-use of context.
- File naming conventions: use kebab-case or PascalCase directories, consistent with your project's style.
- Testing: encourage React Testing Library and Vitest integration.
- Always use MUI components and styling system.
